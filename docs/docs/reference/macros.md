### test_values_between(model, column_name, table_name, low, high)

More enables you to test if metric for specific table_name is between low-high range

Example usage:

```yml title=schema.yml
      - name: re_data_row_count
        tests:
          - test_values_between:
              table_name: "toy_shop"."orders"
              column_name: amount
              low: 0
              high: 10000
```

This will check if metrics gathred for specific table are inside a range
